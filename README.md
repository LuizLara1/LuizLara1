- Hello world.
- I am a PhD candidate at Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP) in the area of Mathematics << Differential Geometry. 

- My interests here are, at first, the following two:
     1. The interface between Computer Sciences and Mathematics (specially tools to Geometry)
     2. The great and interesting Linux world.

I'm not an advanced programmer just an enthusiast trying to learn and enjoy this huge link called GitHub.
